## This is where my solutions/progress for [ml-coursera-python](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments) resides

Specifically, most of my additions are found in the blocks commented by `== YOUR CODE HERE ==` with some optional stuff outside those blocks



Currently using [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) to do grading stuff, etc.

TODO: update forked [branch of ml-coursera-python](https://github.com/GarvinH/ml-coursera-python-assignments) with my solutions
